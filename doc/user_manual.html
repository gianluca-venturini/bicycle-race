			<h3>Map centered application</h3>
			<p>
				The aim of the project is displaying geographical data regarging <strong>Divvy bikes</strong> in the time period that goes from July to December 2013. For that reason evey data is geolocalized on the map that cover the entire surface of the application. An overlay layer of semi-transparent controls is present to let the user iteract with the application. Every control is present only when the user need it. In every moment the user can move the map, zoom in for a more detailed view or zoom out for see more general patterns. 
			</p>

			<h3>Controls</h3>
			<p>
				Controls are the graphical elements that let the user interact. They are designed in a minimalistic style in order to provide only the useful functions in a intuitive and straightforward way. There are two different type of controllers: 
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Active controllers:</strong> that enable the user to request information (that the application will display in different way). They can be hidden when the user don't need them.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Enable controllers:</strong> this kind of controllers enable/disable the visualization of other controllers and for that reason are always visible.
					</li>
				</ul>
